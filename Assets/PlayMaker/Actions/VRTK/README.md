# VRTK Playmaker Action Set

These c# files are created to be used in conjunction with the Unity3d asset Playmaker, along with the VRTK (virtual reality tool kit). They act as bridge to allow VRTK variables to be changed and various methods and events to be called from within Playmaker during Unity3d runtime.
